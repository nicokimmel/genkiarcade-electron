### Windows and MacOS

You have to build it yourself (currently).

## Build it yourself

1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
2. Run `npm run make` to get a distributable. If you want more then a simple archive you have to edit `forge.config.js`.  
    (Check the [official documentation](https://www.electronforge.io/config/makers) or ask ChatGPT to edit the file.)
